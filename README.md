# Leftbook_Mutual_Aid
Can you help with the mutual aid efforts?  I could really use some help if anyone is able to volunteer. The main reason I was considering just sending any funds to TPotL is because it is just me right now, I tell everyone the same thing, this is just a little project that I thought could serve lots of good purposes, teambuilding and comradery is one them. So I don’t really have expectations for wanting to be part of the project. I’m sure if you want to help there’s some way no matter how little time you have. If you’d like to donate something we have paypal/cashapp and square! If you’re unable to help financially it’s we understand. *If nothing else please share the link to the mutual aid store, and encourage your friends and family to support the store which ultimately supports those in need as it gives us money to redistribute.  https://teespring.com/stores/leftbook-mutual-aid-fund In Solidarity, Chris
